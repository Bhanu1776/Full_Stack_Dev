Errors faced in Freelansters website

1) HTML Forms mei submit button has to be input type=submit to ignore onSubmit method not working!!
2) To use cookie parser don't forget to import package in main file of the backend(App.js)
3) For Forms in HTML, A good practice would be keep same NAME for type and name attribute and the name attribute is fucking imp!!
4) label ka htmlFor ka value same rahena chaiyeh input ke id ka value!! (htmlFor="same" && id="same")
5) Never ever directly style elements like (p, h1, a, img) instead of this give id or class to each and every element. -- Just to be safe from fucking conflicts css conflicts
