Steps to follow If we want to create website from scratch

For CSS:
    a) First thing to do is set CSS RESET i.e set those value which is going to apply throughout website
    b) A good practice would be if we create custom CSS Variables ..
    c) Main component 'div' initialize with #id and actual content initialize with .class
    d) Before playing with any element first give border and then adjust accordingly ..
    e) Always adjust margin in opposite direction with negative values to messy marginal space ..
    f) For website responsiveness don't forget to add min, max: height and width, plus making padding and margin as less as screen width

1) The first basic thing for a website is navigation bar, so start with navbar in header, Add up all the stuff which are required
1) Then come up with section part and at the end footer .. Adding copyright is optional!
3) Use utility classes for better efficiency, like use one specific class for whole font, aligning text to center etc
4) Use min and max width, height
5) Give cursor pointer to all buttons 
6) Ship all images in git and export in html via link
7) Add up user-select: none; wherever required and cursor: pointer; for buttons
8) Code clean up like assigning the right variables and aligning the code by order ..

*Alignment by order
display
position
background(or any color related stuff)
All font stuff by order
animations or transitions stuff
(width
height
padding
margin)         These has to be present at the bottom !!
